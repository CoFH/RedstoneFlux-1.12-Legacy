# RedstoneFlux
Standalone Repository for the Redstone Flux API.

As of 1.12, this will be distributed in JAR form instead as a completely standalone dependency.

If you want capabilities, use Forge Energy - it's literally the RF capability. Having said that, why use this at all?

Frankly, there's not a great single reason, except that interfaces are more performant, reliable, and provide a template for you as a coder to make sure that you didn't screw up somewhere. And they're trivial to cast to capabilities.

Or, maybe you just want pure RF and you don't want all the various new <Whatever> Flux variants to power your stuff. That's 100% fine too. :)
